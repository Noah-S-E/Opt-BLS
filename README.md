## Our Work


### **Opt-BLS: Learning to Optimize Boolean Logic Synthesis**

Opt-BLS is a logic synthesis optimization framework based on the **Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB)** algorithm. It tackles the challenges of exploring vast search spaces and avoiding local optima in circuit optimization by:

- **Dependency-Aware Optimization**: Introducing dependency relations through arm combinations and coordinating optimization operators with immediate and long-term reward strategies.
- **Learning with Linear Rewards**: Leveraging domain-specific knowledge to balance exploration and exploitation for decision-making.
- **Parallelization**: Significantly enhancing efficiency and reducing runtime.

Key results include up to **14.47% area improvement** and **1.38× runtime acceleration** for the ASAP 7nm standard cell library. Opt-BLS demonstrates superior performance in **logic optimization**, **FPGA LUT mapping**, and **ASIC technology mapping**.
